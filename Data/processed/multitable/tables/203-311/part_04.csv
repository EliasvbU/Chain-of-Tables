Lexington Avenue / 59th–63rd Streets,59th Street,IRT Lexington Avenue Line,4       5       6  <6>,"The passageways between the Broadway Line and the upper-level local Lexington Avenue Line stations were placed inside fare control on July 1, 1948. When the lower-level express Lexington Avenue platforms opened in 1962 to relieve congestion at the Grand Central – 42nd Street transfer point, those platforms were connected to the local platforms and Broadway Line platforms above. A MetroCard transfer to the IND 63rd Street Line was added on December 16, 2001, when the Queens section of that line was completed. Since the F had moved to the new line, there was no longer a direct transfer to the Lexington Avenue Line, and so this transfer was added with an above-ground walk, free for MetroCard users within two hours of the original boarding."
