"Dr. Bob Piorkowski, Alaska Fish and Game, and his wife",,♂/♀,"October, 1975",Prey-testing agonistic charge,"Tonzona River, Alaska, USA, near Denali National Park","Went outside their remote house near Denali National Park to see why their dog was barking, hoping it was a moose they could hunt. Five wolves came running straight at them, not at the dog, which was more than five meters away. Piorkowski was not ready to fire until the lead wolf was at point-blank range. He shot the next at ten meters away. Both wolves were dead, and the rest fled. Both wolves tested negative for rabies, and Piorkowski had one pelt mounted.",p. 17
David Lawrence,7,♂,"1976, Summer",Prey-testing agonistic charge,"Salcha River, Alaska, USA","While his father, Roy Lawrence, stood near the plane talking to the pilot, Ed Gavin, Roy saw a wolf charging focused directly at his son, David, who was crouching down to touch the water’s edge about 30m/33yards away. The moment Roy saw the wolf charging, it was 50m/55.5 yards from David and moving fast. Roy shouted for David to hide in the brush. When the wolf lost sight of him, it stopped, hopped, and stood on its hind legs trying to sight the boy again, allowing Galvin time to ready his weapon and fire. It was a young adult, underweight female, 32 kg/70.5 lbs.",
"Dr. M. Dawson, Paleontologist",,♀,"1977, June 28",Prey-testing agonistic charge,"Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada","Doing field work when they were approached by a pack of six wolves. They tried to drive them off by shouting, waving, and throwing clods of frozen dirt. The wolves were not deterred, and began to circle. The lead wolf leaped at Dawson's face, but Dawson pushed back with her arms and leaned backwards, pushing the wolf to the ground before it could bite her, and the wolves departed, but the strike was close enough for saliva from the wolf's flews to be left on her cheek. Munthe and Hutchinson (1978) interpreted the attack as testing of unfamiliar prey, but noted they didn't know if the wolves had encountered people before. McNay notes that the attack resembled others by wolves which had been fed.",p. 16
Hunter,19,♂,"January, 1982",Predatory,"Near Duluth, MN, USA","Attacked unseen out of thick cover. Knocked down, the pair rolled on the ground, where he was able to keep it away by grabbing its throat. He could not aim but managed to discharge his weapon, and the wolf fled at the sound. The hunter received claw wounds to the thigh.",
