Tabitha Mullin,,♀,"June, 1995",Agonistic,"Ellsmere Island, Nunavut, Canada","A wildlife biologist, Mullin was standing about five paces outside her front door on the Park warden’s base, observing and recording a pack of eleven wolves who approached and stopped inside 10 meters. One circled around closer, and she moved back toward the door. When she turned to open the door, the wolf grabbed and pulled her forearm. She pulled back, screamed, and her sleeves ripped; the wolf released; she got inside, closed the door, and the wolves left. She suspected photographers had been luring the wolves in with food. She was uninjured.",,,ibRYDj
"Andy Greenblat, Bush pilot",,♂,1997,Prey-testing Agonistic charge,"Joshua Green River Alaska, USA","Greenblat was walking back to camp on a well-worn trail when he saw a wolf angling fast for a point ahead on the trail. When the wolf hit the trail it turned and ran directly at him, maintaining eye contact, ears forward. He yelled and waved his arms, and the wolf put its ears back but kept running and eye contact. At close range Andy was able to fire his weapon. The bullet missed, but the muzzle blast pushed the wolf off line, and the wolf missed. He swung the rifle and hit the wolf's skull; staggered, it ran off. Rabies was not suspected because the animal quickly gave up and ran away.",,,vwSzOGA
Park visitor,,♂,"June, 1999",Agonistic,"Vargas Island Provincial Park, British Columbia, Canada","At about 2am, a wolf began dragging a sleeping man in a sleeping bag. The wolf had moved the man several meters away from the campfire when the man awoke, sat up, and shouted. The wolf stopped, stepped back, and attacked at the midsection, still encased in the sleeping bag. He fought it with his hands and arms, and rolled back towards the fire pit. The wolf bit him on the back and head, leaving multiple lacerations and separating a part of his scalp from the skull before being chased away by a group of other campers. The attack lasted about five minutes.The man was transported to hospital in Victoria, BC, where his scalp flap was reattached with 50 stitches, and wounds to his hands and back were treated. Two wolves were killed the next day, tested negative for rabies, and identified as the same wolves which had been fed and played by people when they were pups. The same wolves had earlier that evening disturbed another camper, and two days earlier had menaced several nature photographers. The stomach contents showed no sign of scavenging human food.",,,rlPxKI
