"Diamond Jenness, Arctic explorer",,♂,"1915, February 10",Agonistic,"Coppermine River, Northwest Territories, Canada","Early in the morning, a female wolf entered the camp of an Arctic expedition and began fighting with the tethered sled dogs. Five men came out and tried to drive it away. The wolf charged at Diamond Jenness after he threw a rock and missed. Jenness grabbed the wolf by the back of the neck, but the wolf turned its head enough to severely bite his forearm. He choked the wolf with his other hand; it released, stepped back, and was shot by another man. The wound was treated and eventually fully healed, but Jenness never contracted rabies despite consistency of the wolf’s behavior with the early stages of the disease.",
"Mike Dusiac, Railwayman",,♂,"December 29, 1942",Possibly rabid,"Poulin, Ontario, Canada","Riding a small rail vehicle called a speeder when a wolf leaped at him and bit his sleeve, knocking him down and knocking the vehicle off the track. Dusiac kept the wolf at bay for more than 25 minutes with an ax. He managed to hit the wolf repeatedly but not squarely enough. The wolf was not deterred by an approaching train which stopped to help Dusiac. Several railwaymen came running, but the wolf would not retreat. The men killed the wolf with picks and shovels. The carcass was inspected by a biologist, and it appeared healthy. However, Rutter and Pimlot reviewed the case in 1968 and concluded that it must have been rabid because of the sustained and determined nature of the attack.",
Zacarias Hugo,14,♂,1943,Possibly rabid,"Etivluk River, Alaska, USA","While hunting caribou, Zacarias heard a sound, turned and saw a large black wolf coming for him. It knocked him down and bit his arm, so he could not use his rifle. It bit his legs, back, arm and neck and dragged him 18 metres before abandoning the attack and disappearing. He walked back to camp, but had lost a lot of blood, mostly from his forearm. His caribou skin Anorak protected him from greater injury or even death, but may have contributed to the attack if it caused the wolf to mistake him for a caribou. This attack had long been classified as \rabid\"" because it occurred during an epizootic of the disease in that area and because Zac's father", Inualuruk

The lead wolf leaped at Dawson's face, but Dawson pushed back with her arms and leaned backwards, pushing the wolf to the ground before it could bite her, and the wolves departed, but the strike was close enough for saliva from the wolf's flews to be left on her cheek.
