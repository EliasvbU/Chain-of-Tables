Treatment,?,Treatment with a glycerol containing solution and chromic acid salts,Coated with magnesium stearate,Uncoated
Type of absorption,Proteolytic enzymatic digestion complete by 90 days.,Proteolytic enzymatic digestion complete in 70 days. Absorption by enzymatic digestion and starts losing tensile strength on implantation from 18–21 days of catgut chromic,Absorption by hydrolysis complete between 60 and 90 days.
