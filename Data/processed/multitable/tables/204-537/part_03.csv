Advantages,"Very high knot-pull tensile strength, good knot security due to special excellent handling features","Very high knot-pull tensile strength, good knot security due to special surface finish, improved smoothness due to the dry presentation of the thread, excellent handling features","High initial tensile strength, guaranteed holding power through the critical wound healing period. Smooth passage through tissue, easy handling, excellent knotting ability, secure knot tying","Tensile strength retention, guaranteed holding power",kSYjqXQ,vDk5Evs,KqGOVES
Indications,"For all surgical procedures especially when tissues that regenerate faster are involved. General closure, ophthalmic, orthopedics, obstetrics/gynecology and gastro-intestinal tract surgery.","For all surgical procedures, especially for tissues that regenerate faster.","Subcutaneous, intracutaneous closures, abdominal and thoracic surgeries","PDS is particularly useful where the combination of an absorbable suture and extended wound support is desirable, pediatric cardiovascular surgery, ophthalmic surgery",UHbDtIi,mH4ho,RhtlBH
Contraindications,Not recommended for incisions that require the sustaining of the tissues for a prolonged period of time.,Not recommended for an incision that requires sustaining of the tissues for a prolonged period of time.,This suture being absorbable should not be used where extended approximation of tissue is required.,This type of suture being absorbable is not to be used where prolonged approximation of tissues under stress is required and/ or in conjunction with prosthetic devices,qOvGqQer,Up97Iws,DBizae
Precautions,"Special precautions should be taken in patients with cancer, anemia and malnutrition conditions. They tend to absorb the sutures at a higher rate. Cardiovascular surgery, due to the continued heart contractions. It is absorbed much faster when used in the mouth and in the vagina, due to the presence of microorganisms. Avoid using where long term tissue approximation is needed. Absorption is faster in infected tissues","It is absorbed much faster when used in the mouth and in the vagina, due to the presence of microorganism. Cardiovascular surgery, due to the continued heart contractions. Special precautions should be taken in patients with cancer, anemia and malnutrition conditions. They tend to absorb this suture at a higher rate.","Special precautions should be taken in elderly patients and patients with history of anemia and malnutrition conditions. As with any suture material, adequate knot security requires the accepted surgical technique of flat and square ties.",The PDS suture knots must be properly placed to be secure. Conjunctival and vaginal mucosal sutures remaining in place for extended periods may be associated with localized irritation. Subcuticular sutures should be placed as deeply as possible in order to minimize the erythema and induration normally associated with absorption.,jSlrn,Z0YYXtw,kgdCUbk
