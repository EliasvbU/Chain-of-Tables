31,Gallium,1875,,P. E. L. de Boisbaudran,P. E. L. de Boisbaudran,Boisbaudran observed on a pyrenea blende sample some emission lines corresponding to the eka-aluminium that was predicted by Mendeleev in 1871 and subsequently isolated the element by electrolysis.
70,Ytterbium,1878,1907,J.C.G. de Marignac,G. Urbain,"On October 22, 1878, Marignac reported splitting terbia into two new earths, terbia proper and ytterbia."
67,Holmium,1878,,M. Delafontaine,,"Delafontaine found it in samarskite and next year, Per Teodor Cleve split Marignac's erbia into erbia proper and two new elements, thulium and holmium."
69,Thulium,1879,1879,T. Cleve,T. Cleve,"Cleve split Marignac's erbia into erbia proper and two new elements, thulium and holmium."
21,Scandium,1879,1879,F. Nilson,F. Nilson,Nilson split Marignac's ytterbia into pure ytterbia and a new element that matched 1871 Mendeleev's predicted eka-boron.
62,Samarium,1879,1879,P.E.L. de Boisbaudran,P.E.L. de Boisbaudran,Boisbaudran noted a new earth in samarskite and named it samaria after the mineral.
64,Gadolinium,1880,1886,J. C. G. de Marignac,F. L. de Boisbaudran,"Marignac initially observed the new earth in terbia, and later Boisbaudran obtained a pure sample from samarskite."
