56,Barium,1772,1808,W. Scheele,H. Davy,Scheele distinguished a new earth (BaO) in pyrolusite and Davy isolated the metal by electrolysis.
42,Molybdenum,1778,1781,W. Scheele,J. Hjelm,Scheele recognised the metal as a constituent of molybdena.
52,Tellurium,1782,,F.-J.M. von Reichenstein,H. Klaproth,Muller observed it as an impurity in gold ores from Transylvania.
74,Tungsten,1781,1783,T. Bergman,J. and F. Elhuyar,Bergman obtained from scheelite an oxide of a new element. The Elhuyars obtained tungstic acid from wolframite and reduced it with charcoal.
38,Strontium,1787,1808,W. Cruikshank,H. Davy,Cruikshank and Adair Crawford in 1790 concluded that strontianite contained a new earth. It was eventually isolated electrochemically in 1808 by Humphry Davy.
,,1789,,A. Lavoisier,,"The first modern list of chemical elements – containing, among others, 23 elements of those known then. He also redefined the term \element\"". Until then"
40,Zirconium,1789,1824,H. Klaproth,J. Berzelius,Klaproth identified a new element in zirconia.
92,Uranium,1789,1841,H. Klaproth,E.-M. Péligot,Mistakenly identified a uranium oxide obtained from pitchblende as the element itself and named it after the recently discovered planet Uranus.
22,Titanium,1791,1825,W. Gregor,J. Berzelius,Gregor found an oxide of a new metal in ilmenite; Martin Heinrich Klaproth independently discovered the element in rutile in 1795 and named it. The pure metallic form was only obtained in 1910 by Matthew A. Hunter.
39,Yttrium,1794,1840,J. Gadolin,G. Mosander,"Discovered in gadolinite, but Mosander showed later that its ore, yttria, contained more elements."
4,Beryllium,1798,1828,N. Vauquelin,F. Wöhler and A. Bussy,"Vauquelin discovered the oxide in beryl and emerald, and Klaproth suggested the present name around 1808."
