Z,Element,Observed or predicted,Isolated (widely known),Observer,First isolator,Notes
5,Boron,1808,1808,L. Gay-Lussac and L.J. Thénard,H. Davy,"On June 21, 1808, Lussac and Thénard announced a new element in sedative salt, Davy announced the isolation of a new substance from boracic acid soon afterwards."
9,Fluorine,1810,1886,A.-M. Ampère,H. Moissan,"André-Marie Ampère predicted an element analogous to chlorine obtainable from hydrofluoric acid, and between 1812 and 1886 many researchers tried to obtain this element. It was eventually isolated by Moissan."
53,Iodine,1811,1811,B. Courtois,B. Courtois,Courtois discovered it in the ashes of seaweed.
3,Lithium,1817,1821,A. Arfwedson,W. T. Brande,Arfwedson discovered the alkali in petalite.
48,Cadmium,1817,1817,"S. L Hermann, F. Stromeyer, and J.C.H. Roloff","S. L Hermann, F. Stromeyer, and J.C.H. Roloff","All three found an unknown metal in a sample of zinc oxide from Silesia, but the name that Stromeyer gave became the accepted one."
34,Selenium,1817,1817,J. Berzelius and G. Gahn,J. Berzelius and G. Gahn,"While working with lead they discovered a substance that they thought was tellurium, but realized after more investigation that it is different."
14,Silicon,1824,1824,J. Berzelius,J. Berzelius,"Humphry Davy thought in 1800 that silica was an element, not a compound, and in 1808 suggested the present name. In 1811 Louis-Joseph Gay-Lussac and Louis-Jacques Thénard probably prepared impure silicon, but Berzelius is credited with the discovery for obtaining the pure element in 1824."
13,Aluminium,1825,1825,H.C.Ørsted,H.C.Ørsted,"Antoine Lavoisier predicted in 1787 that alumine is the oxide of an undiscovered element, and in 1808 Humphry Davy tried to decompose it. Although he failed, he suggested the present name. Hans Christian Ørsted was the first to isolate metallic aluminium in 1825."
35,Bromine,1825,1825,J. Balard and L. Gmelin,J. Balard and L. Gmelin,They both discovered the element in the autumn of 1825 and published the results the next year.
90,Thorium,1829,,J. Berzelius,,Berzelius obtained the oxide of a new earth in thorite.
