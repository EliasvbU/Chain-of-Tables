57,Lanthanum,1838,,G. Mosander,,"Mosander found a new element in samples of ceria and published his results in 1842, but later he showed that this lanthana contained four more elements."
68,Erbium,1842,,G. Mosander,,"Mosander managed to split the old yttria into yttria proper and erbia, and later terbia too."
65,Terbium,1842,1842,G. Mosander,G. Mosander,"In 1842 Mosander split yttria into two more earths, erbia and terbia"
44,Ruthenium,1807,1844,J. Sniadecki,J. Sniadecki,"Sniadecki isolated the element in 1807, but his work was not ratified. Gottfried Wilhelm Osann thought that he found three new metals in Russian platinum samples, and in 1844 Karl Karlovich Klaus confirmed that there was a new element. Klaus is usually recognized as the discoverer of the element."
55,Caesium,1860,1882,R. Bunsen and R. Kirchhoff,C. Setterberg,Bunsen and Kirchhoff were the first to suggest finding new elements by spectrum analysis. They discovered caesium by its two blue emission lines in a sample of Dürkheim mineral water. The pure metal was eventually isolated in 1882 by Setterberg.
37,Rubidium,1861,,R. Bunsen and G. R. Kirchhoff,R. Bunsen,"Bunsen and Kirchhoff discovered it just a few months after caesium, by observing new spectral lines in the mineral lepidolite. Bunsen never obtained a pure sample of the metal, which was later obtained by Hervesy."
81,Thallium,1861,1862,W. Crookes,C.-A. Lamy,"Shortly after the discovery of rubidium, Crookes found a new green line in a selenium sample; later that year, Lamy found the element to be metallic."
49,Indium,1863,1867,F. Reich and T. Richter,T. Richter,Reich and Richter First identified it in sphalerite by its bright indigo-blue spectroscopic emission line. Richter isolated the metal several years later.
2,Helium,1868,1895,P. Janssen and N. Lockyer,"W. Ramsay, T. Cleve, and N. Langlet","Janssen and Lockyer observed independently a yellow line in the solar spectrum that did not match any other element.Years later, Ramsay, Cleve, and Langlet observed independently the element trapped in cleveite about the same time."
,,1869,,D. I. Mendeleev,,Mendeleev arranges the 63 elements known at that time into the first modern periodic table and correctly predicts several others.
