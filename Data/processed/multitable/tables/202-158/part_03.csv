23,Vanadium,1801,1830,M. del Río,N.G.Sefström,"Río found the metal in vanadinite but retracted the claim after Hippolyte Victor Collet-Descotils disputed it. Sefström isolated and named it, and later it was shown that Río had been right in the first place.",UdWPbDBR,wJESehJJ
41,Niobium,1801,1864,C. Hatchett,W. Blomstrand,"Hatchett found the element in columbite ore and named it columbium. Heinrich Rose proved in 1844 that the element is distinct from tantalum, and renamed it niobium which was officially accepted in 1949.",ZSBnqYf4,EkmYMhn
73,Tantalum,1802,,G. Ekeberg,,"Ekeberg found another element in minerals similar to columbite and in 1844, Heinrich Rose proved that it was distinct from niobium.",r6z7jfg,LIOzQBN
46,Palladium,1803,1803,H. Wollaston,H. Wollaston,"Wollaston discovered it in samples of platinum from South America, but did not publish his results immediately. He had intended to name it after the newly discovered asteroid, Ceres, but by the time he published his results in 1804, cerium had taken that name. Wollaston named it after the more recently discovered asteroid Pallas.",NojBK,pnWMmbQ
58,Cerium,1803,1839,"H. Klaproth, J. Berzelius, and W. Hisinger",G. Mosander,"Berzelius and Hisinger discovered the element in ceria and named it after the newly discovered asteroid (then considered a planet), Ceres. Klaproth discovered it simultaneously and independently in some tantalum samples. Mosander proved later that the samples of all three researchers had at least another element in them, lanthanum.",Yv3kN,YRocRxA
76,Osmium,1803,1803,S. Tennant,S. Tennant,"Tennant had been working on samples of South American platinum in parallel with Wollaston and discovered two new elements, which he named osmium and iridium.",pnPsco,WHcqddt
77,Iridium,1803,1803,S. Tennant,S. Tennant,"Tennant had been working on samples of South American platinum in parallel with Wollaston and discovered two new elements, which he named osmium and iridium, and published the iridium results in 1804.",IySFM,smtgGl
45,Rhodium,1804,1804,H. Wollaston,H. Wollaston,Wollaston discovered and isolated it from crude platinum samples from South America.,PbHEtf6,HshUc
19,Potassium,1807,1807,H. Davy,H. Davy,Davy discovered it by using electrolysis on potash.,AxTZI01,cYmUJ
11,Sodium,1807,1807,H. Davy,H. Davy,"Davy discovered it a few days after potassium, by using electrolysis on sodium hydroxide.",J6jSNW5,TEBRNLtJ
20,Calcium,1808,1808,H. Davy,H. Davy,Davy discovered the metal by electrolysis of quicklime.,xE6bCd15,gxOEYIvK
