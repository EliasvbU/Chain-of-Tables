Z,Element,Observed or predicted,Isolated (widely known),Observer,First isolator,Notes
96,Curium,1944,,"G. T. Seaborg, R. A. James and A. Ghiorso",,Prepared by bombarding plutonium with alpha particles during the Manhattan Project
61,Promethium,1942,1945,"S. Wu, E.G. Segrè and A. Bethe","Charles D. Coryell, Jacob A. Marinsky, Lawrence E. Glendenin, and Harold G. Richter","It was probably first prepared in 1942 by bombarding neodymium and praseodymium with neutrons, but separation of the element could not be carried out. Isolation was performed under the Manhattan Project in 1945."
