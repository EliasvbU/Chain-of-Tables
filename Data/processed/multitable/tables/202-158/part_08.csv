71,Lutetium,1906,1906,G. Urbain and C.A. von Welsbach,G. Urbain and C.A. von Welsbach,Urbain and von Welsbach proved independently that the old ytterbium also contained a new element.,rVZhdj,sWzBcU
75,Rhenium,1908[contradiction],1908,M. Ogawa,M. Ogawa,"Ogawa found it in thorianite but assigned it as element 43 instead of 75 and named it nipponium. In 1922 Walter Noddack, Ida Eva Tacke and Otto Berg announced its separation from gadolinite and gave it the present name.",XqBgotv,uCFJl
72,Hafnium,1911,1922,G. Urbain and V. Vernadsky,D. Coster and G. von Hevesy,"Urbain claimed to have found the element in rare-earth residues, while Vernadsky independently found it in orthite. Neither claim was confirmed due to World War I. After the war, Coster and Hevesy found it by X-ray spectroscopic analysis in Norwegian zircon. Hafnium was the next to last element with stable isotopes to be discovered.",qCeMB,BkSefGF
91,Protactinium,1913,,O.H.Göhring and K. Fajans,,The two obtained the first isotope of this element that had been predicted by Mendeleev in 1871 as a member of the natural decay of 238U. Originally isolated in 1900 by William Crookes.,oSKEtmW,nbPOHNf
43,Technetium,1937,1937,C. Perrier and E. Segrè,C. Perrier & E.Segrè,"The two discovered a new element in a molybdenum sample that was used in a cyclotron, the first synthetic element to be discovered. It had been predicted by Mendeleev in 1871 as eka-manganese.",sVuMKF,AJgOb
87,Francium,1939,,M. Perey,,"Perey discovered it as a decay product of 227Ac. Francium is the last element to be discovered in nature, rather than synthesized in the lab, although some of the \synthetic\"" elements that were discovered later (plutonium",AjQdxyB,EaIYiex
85,Astatine,1940,,"R. Corson, R. Mackenzie and E. Segrè",,Obtained by bombarding bismuth with alpha particles. Later determined to occur naturally in minuscule quantities (<25 grams in earth's crust).,IuEECa,sEUinZl
93,Neptunium,1940,,E.M. McMillan and H. Abelson,,"Obtained by irradiating uranium with neutrons, it is the first transuranium element discovered.",pBWAqEfd,iXJqMPIm
94,Plutonium,1940–1941,,"Glenn T. Seaborg, Arthur C. Wahl, W. Kennedy and E.M. McMillan",,Prepared by bombardment of uranium with deuterons.,skaBY,rdfPM
95,Americium,1944,,"G. T. Seaborg, A. James, O. Morgan and A. Ghiorso",,Prepared by irradiating plutonium with neutrons during the Manhattan Project.,SoIoJxAE,oUZrw
