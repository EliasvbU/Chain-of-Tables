15,Phosphorus,1669,1669,H. Brand,H. Brand,"Prepared from urine, it was the first element to be chemically discovered."
27,Cobalt,1732,,G. Brandt,,Proved that the blue color of glass is due to a new kind of metal and not bismuth as thought previously.
78,Platinum,1735,1735,A. de Ulloa,A. de Ulloa,"First description of a metal found in South American gold was in 1557 by Julius Caesar Scaliger. Ulloa published his findings in 1748, but Sir Charles Wood also investigated the metal in 1741. First reference to it as a new metal was made by William Brownrigg in 1750."
28,Nickel,1751,1751,F. Cronstedt,F. Cronstedt,Found by attempting to extract copper from the mineral known as fake copper (now known as niccolite).
83,Bismuth,1753,,C.F. Geoffroy,,Definitively identified by Claude François Geoffroy in 1753.
12,Magnesium,1755,1808,J. Black,H. Davy,Black observed that magnesia alba (MgO) was not quicklime (CaO). Davy isolated the metal electrochemically from magnesia.
1,Hydrogen,1766,1500,H. Cavendish,Paracelsus,"Cavendish was the first to distinguish H2 from other gases, although Paracelsus around 1500, Robert Boyle, and Joseph Priestley had observed its production by reacting strong acids with metals. Lavoisier named it in 1793."
8,Oxygen,1771,1771,W. Scheele,W. Scheele,"Obtained it by heating mercuric oxide and nitrates in 1771, but did not publish his findings until 1777. Joseph Priestley also prepared this new air by 1774, but only Lavoisier recognized it as a true element; he named it in 1777."
7,Nitrogen,1772,1772,D. Rutherford,D. Rutherford,"He discovered Nitrogen while he was studying at the University of Edinburgh. He showed that the air in which animals had breathed, even after removal of the exhaled carbon dioxide, was no longer able to burn a candle. Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Henry Cavendish, and Joseph Priestley also studied the element at about the same time, and Lavoisier named it in 1775-6."
17,Chlorine,1774,1774,W. Scheele,W. Scheele,"Obtained it from hydrochloric acid, but thought it was an oxide. Only in 1808 did Humphry Davy recognize it as an element."
25,Manganese,1774,1774,W. Scheele,G. Gahn,"Distinguished pyrolusite as the calx of a new metal. Ignatius Gottfred Kaim also discovered the new metal in 1770, as did Scheele in 1774. It was isolated by reduction of manganese dioxide with carbon."
