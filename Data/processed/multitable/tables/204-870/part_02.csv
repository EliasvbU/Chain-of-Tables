Java Universal Network/Graph (JUNG) Framework,"network and graph manipulation, analysis, and visualization","built-in support for GraphML, Pajek, and some text formats; user can create parsers for any desired format","built-in support for GraphML, Pajek, and some text formats; user can create exporters for any desired format",Any platform supporting Java,Open source (BSD license),"JUNG is a Java API and library that provides a common and extensible language for the modeling, analysis, and visualization of relational data. It supports a variety of graph types (including hypergraphs), supports graph elements of any type and with any properties, enables customizable visualizations, and includes algorithms from graph theory, data mining, and social network analysis (e.g., clustering, decomposition, optimization, random graph generation, statistical analysis, distances, flows, and centrality (PageRank, HITS, etc.)). It is limited only by the amount of memory allocated to Java."
