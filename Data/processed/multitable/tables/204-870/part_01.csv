AllegroGraph,Graph Database. RDF with Gruff visualization tool,RDF,RDF,"Linux, Mac, Windows",Free and Commercial,"AllegroGraph is a graph database. It is disk-based, fully transactional OLTP database that stores data structured in graphs rather than in tables. AllegroGraph includes a Social Networking Analytics library."
EgoNet,Ego-centric network analysis,Conducts interviews or takes any valid XML file,Output to CSV and convertible to almost any other format,Any system supporting Java,"Open Source, seeking contributors","Egonet is a program for the collection and analysis of egocentric network data. Egonet contains facilities to assist in creating the questionnaire, collecting the data and providing general global network measures and data matrixes that can be used in further analysis by other software programs."
Gephi,Graph exploration and manipulation software,"GraphViz(.dot), Graphlet(.gml), GUESS(.gdf), LEDA(.gml), NetworkX(.graphml, .net), NodeXL(.graphml, .net), Pajek(.net, .gml), Sonivis(.graphml), Tulip(.tlp, .dot), UCINET(.dl), yEd(.gml), Gephi (.gexf), Edge list(.csv), databases","GUESS(.gdf), Gephi(.gexf), .svg, .png",Any system supporting Java 1.6 and OpenGL,"Open Source (GPL3), seeking contributors","Gephiis an interactive visualization and exploration platform for all kinds of networks and complex systems, dynamic and hierarchical graphs. It is a tool for people that have to explore and understand graphs. The user interacts with the representation, manipulate the structures, shapes and colors to reveal hidden properties. It uses a 3D render engine to display large networks in real-time and to speed up the exploration. A flexible and multi-task architecture brings new possibilities to work with complex data sets and produce valuable visual results."
GraphStream,Dynamic Graph Library,"GraphStream(.dgs), GraphViz(.dot), Graphlet(.gml), edge list","GraphStream(.dgs), GraphViz(.dot), Graphlet(.gml), image sequence",Any system supporting Java,Open Source,"With GraphStream you deal with graphs. Static and Dynamic.You create them from scratch, from a file or any source. You display and render them."
