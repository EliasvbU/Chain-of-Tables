SADIE,1966,Sterling And Decimal Invoicing Electronically,"Programming stored on soldered-through connectors on double-sided printed circuit cards, connecting instruction type on one side of the card with instruction number on the other side. IBM 2741 Selectric-style golf-ball teleprinter for user interface.",Nickel acoustic delay line working storage (8 words of decimal arithmetic). Paper tape and edge-punched cards. Magnetic stripe cards for the teleprinter-style user interface. Could be switched between decimal and Sterling at the flick of a switch as it said in the publicity.
SUSIE,1967,Stock Updating and Sales Invoicing Electronically,"Programmes (2) stored on drum, each with 1000 machine instructions. Programme could be loaded from or written out to paper tape. User interface as SADIE.","As for SADIE, plus magnetic drum (6k words)"
Mark 1,1970,Sales Order processing,"Architecture similar to the Data General \NOVA\"" in that the memory and I/O highways were separate whereas DEC used a common highway for memory and I/O with the peripherals occupying memory addresses. The NOVA was a 16 bit design but the Molecular was 18 bit allowing signed arithmetic and a memory parity check bit. The instruction set was in some ways similar to the Nova. The M18 was designed by a small team headed by Colin Chapman & Ian Miller.",
"Operating system known as LOS developed by Joe Templeman in Leicester office of Systemation. Programming was done in octal notation machine code in longhand using coding sheets. The 17 bit word allowed the limited storage of 3 bytes per word using \""Metacode\""""",Ferrite core memory. from Plessey or Fabritek and later EMM.Front-loading disk driveOptional paper tape reader D400 front-loading cartridge 875 kbit D800 1.75 Mbit,,,
Mark 2,1973,Sales Order Processing,"Totally new processor with hardware interrupt stacking, a variable cycle time and new disc controller. Same basic architecture as the MK1. Used a totally new OS.Water-cooled cabinets with remote chiller unit initially, later normal fan cooling.",Fabritek or EMM ferrite core memory. Introduced the DD1600 CDC 9427 top-loading disk drive one fixed one removable and/or a large multi-platter CDC removable disk drive.
