Mark 3,,,Designation not used but was effectively the 3ME/6ME which was a MK2 processor modified to run the MK1 OS and application software. Hardware interrupt stacking disabled. Used a low capacity version of the CDC 9427,,snoxdkI,,108
Mark 4,,"SOP, Livestock Markets, Paper merchants, Plumbers merchants.",Developed after the demise of BCL by ABS computers. Basically a 6ME in a new cabinet with lead acid battery backed static RAM instead of ferrite core.Programming still done in octal notation machine code in longhand using coding sheets.,"Core Memory or static RAM, Introduced the CDC Hawk 9427H disk drive, up to 4 supported per controller, max 2 controllers and/or a large multi-platter CDC D8000 removable disk drive.",FDDab,,483
Mark 5,1984,"SOP, Livestock Markets, Paper merchants, Plumbers merchants.",Basically a re engineering of the 6ME processor to remove redundant stack logic and reduced to 3 boards with a printed circuit backplane instead of the costly wire wrapped backplane used for earlier models.Hardware re-design by Systemation Developments K. A. Howlett (Keith Alec b1943 son of W A Howlett)with assistance in the final test stages by G. Boote. Cabinet design by Business Computers Systems Ltd. Hardware designed and manufactured by Systemation Developments for Business computers Systems.,"Initially large-format Ampex ferrite core memory then static RAM, both introduced by Systemation Developments.Later Bank switching memory introduced (32K 18 bit words base memory plus up to 8 X 32K banks).First sold with CDC Hawk 9427H drives later CDC Lark 2 disk drives. Memory and new RS232 4 port I/O card (Quad I/O) by K. A. Howlett, Lark 2 disc controller by J. Adams. Up to four CDC Lark or Amcodyne drives per controller, max 2 controllers.",DwZouJsI,,20
Distributor,1986,"SOP, Livestock Markets, Paper merchants, Plumbers merchants.","Smaller version of the Mark 5 in an oversized PC style vertical cabinet with a CDC Lark 2 drive built in. Designed and manufactured by Systemation Developments K. A. Howlett for Business Computers Systems. A single board processor was developed to replace the 3 card processor and was working but never came to market. At the same time a Transputer based maths co-processor had also been developed. Assembler programming introduced by Systemation Developments with the aid of a third party, running on PC's with the program then downloaded to the M18.",Support for seven additional external Lark 2 or Amcodyne drives 4 per controller including the integral drive. 32K 18 bit words of base memory plus up to 8 32K banks.,gWdTYEj,,196
